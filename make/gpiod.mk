#
# gpiod.mk
#
# This makefile assumes Makefile variable RPIFS expands to a canonical path
# string that identifies a folder on your Linux desktop onto which the
# Raspberry Pi's file system is already mounted.  The default value for
# RPIFS is '${HOME}/rpifs/'.
#
# HINT: Use the command `mount.rpifs' to mount the Raspberry Pi's file
# system onto folder ${HOME}/rpifs/.
#
# The header files and library files for the gpiod library are installed on
# the Raspberry Pi's file system; they are not available on the desktop
# computer:
#	gpiod header files  > $(RPIFS)/usr/include/gpiod.{h,hpp}
#	gpiod library files > $(RPIFS)/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/
#
# When cross compiling, your makefile must add these paths to the
# preprocessor's header file search path, and to the linker's library file
# search path.
