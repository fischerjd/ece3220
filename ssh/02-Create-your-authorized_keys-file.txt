Create Your `authorized_keys' File

These instructions perform the tasks listed below, and in the same order as
shown here:
    
    * Creates a file named `~/.ssh/authorized_keys' if it doesn't yet exist.
    * Sets the file access permission on file `authorized_keys' to the
      required value of 0600 (i.e., -rw-------).
    * Stores the contents of your public SSH key file `id_ed25519.pub'
      in your `authorized_keys' file.

[Note 1.  The commands shown below must be executed on the Linux computer
that has your SSH key files.  If you have not yet created your SSH key
files, follow the instructions in the file named
    01-Create-your-SSH-key-files.txt
before you perform the instructions in this file. --end note]

[Note 2.  The dollar sign '$' at the beginning of each command line is the
Bash shell's command prompt.  The command line text appears to the right of
the dollar sign--i.e., to the right of the command prompt '$'. Do not type
the dollar sign when entering a command. --end note]

[Note 3.  In the examples below, wherever you see the word `pawprint', this
should be your Mizzou single sign-on (SSO) pawprint; it is not the word
`pawprint'.  --end note]

[Note 4.  The file access permissions on file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys' must
be 0600 (i.e. `-rw-------').  See the instructions below. --end note]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/.ssh/

# Create file `authorized_keys' if it doesn't yet exist.
$ touch authorized_keys

# Set the required file access permission on file `authorized_keys'.
$ chmod 0600 authorized_keys.
$ ls -l authorized_keys 
-rw------- 1 pawprint pawprint 130 Feb  7 00:14 authorized_keys

# If your `authorized_keys' file does not yet contain a copy of your public
# key `id_ed25519.pub', then store the contents of file `id_ed25519.pub' in
# your `authorized_keys' file.
$ fingerprint="$(cut -d " " -f2 id_ed25519.pub)"
$ grep -q "$fingerprint" authorized_keys || cat id_ed25519.pub >> authorized_keys
$ unset fingerprint
