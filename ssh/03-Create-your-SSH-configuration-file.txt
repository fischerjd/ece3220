Create Your SSH Configuration File

[Note 1.  The commands shown below must be executed on the Linux computer
that has your SSH key files.  If you have not yet created your SSH key
files, follow the instructions in the files named
    01-Create-your-SSH-key-files.txt
    02-Create-your-authorized_keys-file.txt
before you perform the instructions in this file. --end note]

[Note 2.  The dollar sign '$' at the beginning of each command line is the
Bash shell's command prompt.  The command line text appears to the right of
the dollar sign--i.e., to the right of the command prompt '$'. Do not type
the dollar sign when entering a command. --end note]

[Note 3.  In the examples below, wherever you see the word `pawprint', this
should be your Mizzou single sign-on (SSO) pawprint; it is not the word
`pawprint'.  --end note]

[Note 4.  The file access permissions on file `~/.ssh/config' must be
`-rw-------' (0600) as shown in the instructions below. --end note]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/.ssh/

$ install -m 0600 ~/git/ece3220/ssh/config ~/.ssh/

$ ls -l ~/.ssh/config
-rw------- 1 pawprint pawprint 3475 Oct 22 15:50 /home/pawprint/.ssh/config

# PAWPRINT
# The command line shown below creates a Bash shell environment variable
# named `PAWPRINT', and it initializes the variable's value as `abc123'.
# When you define the environment variable `PAWPRINT', enter your own
# pawprint as the variable's value; do not use the example pawprint value
# `abc123'.

$ PAWPRINT='abc123'


# Use the stream editor program `sed' to replace all instances of
#   User __your_pawprint__
# in your `config' file with
#   User $PAWPRINT
# Note that the Bash shell replaces the expression `$PAWPRINT' with the
# value that is stored in the PAWPRINT environment variable, which is your
# Mizzou pawprint.

$ sed -i.bak -E "s/User[ \t]+__your_pawprint__/User $PAWPRINT/g" ~/.ssh/config
