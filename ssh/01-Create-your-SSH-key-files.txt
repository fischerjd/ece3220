Create Your Secure Shell (SSH) Key Files

[Note 1.  The commands shown below must be executed on a Linux computer.
--end note]

[Note 2.  The dollar sign '$' at the beginning of each command line is the
Bash shell's command prompt.  The command line text appears to the right of
the dollar sign--i.e., to the right of the command prompt '$'. Do not type
the dollar sign when entering a command. --end note]

[Note 3.  In the examples below, wherever you see the word `pawprint', this
should be your Mizzou single sign-on (SSO) pawprint; it is not the word
`pawprint'.  --end note]

[Note 4.  On the `ssh-keygen' command line, the option '-C' must be an
uppercase C, not a lowercase 'c'. --end note]

[Note 5.  When the `ssh-keygen' program prompts you to "Enter [the name of
the] file in which to save the key," press the keyboard's ENTER key to use
the default file name and file path, i.e., ~/.ssh/id_ed25519. --end note]

[Note 6.  When the `ssh-keygen' program prompts you to "Enter [a]
passphrase for [your private key] '/home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519'," enter
an easy-to-remember passphrase for the private key, and then press the
ENTER key. --end note]

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -C "$USER@umsystem.edu"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519): 

Enter passphrase for "/home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519" (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 

Your identification has been saved in /home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Verify the access permissions on folder ~/.ssh/:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls -l -d ~/.ssh/
drwx------ 4 pawprint pawprint 4096 Feb  5 13:08 /home/pawprint/.ssh/


[Note 1.  The access permissions on folder `~/.ssh/' must be `drwx------'
as shown above. If the access permissions on your `~/.ssh/' folder are
different from this, use the `chmod' program to redefine that folder's
access permissions as shown below:

$ chmod 0700 ~/.ssh/

--end note]


===========================================================================
Verify the access permissions on your SSH key files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls -l ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
-rw------- 1 pawprint pawprint 509 Feb  5 13:08 /home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519
-rw-r--r-- 1 pawprint pawprint 130 Feb  5 13:08 /home/pawprint/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


[Note 1.  Your PRIVATE key file is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519'.  DO NOT SHARE YOUR
PRIVATE KEY FILE WITH OTHERS.  The file access permissions on your PRIVATE
key file must be `-rw-------' as shown above.  If the access permissions
are different from this, use the `chmod' program to redefine that file's
access permissions as shown below:

$ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

--end note]

[Note 2.  Your PUBLIC key file is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub'.  The file access
permissions on your PUBLIC key file should be `-rw-r--r--' as shown above.
If the access permissions are different from this, use the `chmod' program
to redefine that file's access permissions as shown below:

$ chmod 0644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

--end note]
