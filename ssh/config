# This is the ssh client configuration file.  See ssh_config(5) for more
# details.
#
# :: IMPORTANT ::
# As stated in 'man 5 ssh_config': "Since the first obtained value for each
# parameter is used, more host-specific declarations should be given near
# the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end."
#
# :: IMPORTANT ::
# Older releases of Raspberry Pi OS (e.g., Jessie) do not support modern
# SSH protocols. To connect to hosts that use older versions of the
# Raspbian OS, modify the SSH command line as described in Sang's blog
# post, "ssh handshake is rejected with 'no mutual signature algorithm'
# error" [1]:
#   $ ssh -o 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa' pi@EECSpi
# Alternatively, use this config file to automatically supply those
# arguments to the SSH command line.
